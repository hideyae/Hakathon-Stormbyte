> **"Google Maps for fishermen" - Using NASA satellite data to answer one critical question: "Is it safe to go fishing today?"**

---

## 🚀 What Does It Do & How It Works

SeaCast is a maritime safety intelligence platform that transforms NASA's satellite data into life-saving information for fishermen and coastal communities. Our system answers one critical question: **"Is it safe to go fishing today?"**

### 🎯 The Core Concept
SeaCast provides three clear risk levels:
- ✅ **SAFE** = Go fishing confidently
- ⚠️ **CAUTION** = Be careful, conditions are moderate  
- 🚫 **DANGER** = Stay home, it's too risky

### 🔄 System Workflow
```
NASA Satellites → Maritime Data → Risk Analysis → Safety Recommendation
```

### 🧠 How It Works
1. **User Input**: Fisherman enters location and date
2. **NASA Data Fetch**: System retrieves real-time satellite data (wind, waves, currents, visibility)
3. **Risk Calculation**: AI analyzes maritime conditions and calculates safety levels
4. **Visual Dashboard**: Shows conditions with clear risk indicators
5. **AI Assistant**: Explains conditions in simple language and provides recommendations

## 🎣 The SeaCast Story

> *"Meet Hassan. He's a fisherman in Morocco. Every morning at 5 AM, he faces a terrifying decision: Should I risk my life at sea today to feed my family?*
>
> *Weather apps show him temperature and rain - but not what he really needs: Are the waves safe? Is the wind too strong? Will I come home alive?*
>
> *Last year, Hassan's friend didn't come home. A storm that weather apps missed took his life.*
>
> *This is why we built SeaCast."*

**Made with ❤️ for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

*Saving lives at sea, one weather prediction at a time.*
